# cycloneIV-mips-processor
Processor designed to operate on the Altera Cyclone IV FPGA as part of ECE437: Introduction to Digital Computer Design.

This processor was designed iteratively in multiple stages all stored on individual branches with tags: a single cycle iteration, a pipelined iteration, pipelined with instruction and data caches, and finally a dual-core pipelined processor with caches.

In order to use this design, there are three possible methods of execution:
1) Source simulation
2) Mapped simulation
3) Hardware
